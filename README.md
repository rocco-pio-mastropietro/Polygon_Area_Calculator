# polygon-area-calculator

This is one of the required projects to earn my Scientific Computing with Python certification by freeCodeCamp. 
In this project I used object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class is a subclass of Rectangle, and inherits its methods and attributes.
